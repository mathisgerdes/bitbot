## Compiling for the micro:bit
Compilation requires yotta, for an introduction read [this](https://lancaster-university.github.io/microbit-docs/offline-toolchains/#yotta) article.

Here is a short overview:
- `yt build` build the project
- hex file is placed into `/build/<TARGET_NAME>/source` (flash `microbit-combined.hex` by copying it onto the microbit)
